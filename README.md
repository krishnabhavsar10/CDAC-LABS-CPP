- Sum of digits of a 4-digit number (using loop and recursion)
- Find the roots of an equation using a function

---

## Day 2: Fundamental Calculations
- Find roots of equations
- Calculate simple interest (using principal, rate, and time)
- Check if a number is odd or even
- Check if a character is a lowercase or uppercase letter
- Fibonacci series using recursion
- Binary equivalent of a number using recursion
- Running sum of n numbers using recursion
- Area calculations (circle, rectangle, square)

---

## Day 3: Patterns
- Right-aligned triangle pattern
- Pyramid pattern
- Hollow diamond pattern

---

## Day 4: Functions and Recursion
- Swap two numbers by reference
- Print an array of student names
- Factorial series using recursion
- Reverse a string using recursion

---

## Day 5: Arrays and Student Struct
- Create a `Student` struct (roll number and name)
- Accept and display an array of students
- Sort a dynamically allocated array of numbers
- Print a character array as a string
- Calculate and display average of an array of numbers
- Multiply each number in an array by 2 and display the result

---

## Day 6: Classes and Sorting
- Create a `Student` class (roll number and name)
- Accept and display student data, and sort by roll number
- Create an `Employee` class (empNo, name, salary, dept) and accept/display data

---

## Day 7: Constructors and Object Pointers
- Implement constructor and parameterized constructor in `Student` class
- Test object creation with `new` operator and array of students
- Implement constructor in `Account` class; add account, display account, and perform transactions (withdraw/deposit) using menu-driven program

---

## Day 8: Static Members and Separate Files
- Use static data member for account number generation in `Account` class
- Separate header and implementation files for `Student`, `Complex`, and `Employee` classes
- Static data member in `Complex` class to count objects; implement parameterized and no-arg constructors

---

## Day 9: References and Array of Pointers
- Swap function using references
- Pass const reference to factorial function and check immutability
- Array of pointers in `Account` assignment
- Array class with constructor, destructor, and Accept/Display functions

---

## Day 10: Operator Overloading
- Implement copy constructor, overload `[]` and `+` operators in `Array` class
- Overload `+`, `-`, and `*` operators for `Complex` class

---

## Day 11: Time and Student-Address Association
- `Time` class with add, subtract, read, and print functions
- Overload `+`, `-`, `<<`, and `>>` operators for `Time`, `Student`, and `Account` classes
- Association between `Student` and `Address` classes (separate files)

---

## Day 12: Class Hierarchies
- Practice `Player` and `Shape` examples
- Create `Employee` hierarchy with `PermEmployee` and `ContractEmployee` classes
- Use abstract `CalcSalary` function in base class, overridden in derived classes

---

## Day 13: File Handling
- `MobilePhone` class with options to add/read/sort from file
- (Optional) Program to copy binary file to another binary file

---

## Day 14: Templates
- Function templates for swap, add, subtract, multiply, and divide
- Array class with class templates for storing different data types (int, float, char)

---

## Day 15: STL Containers
- Experiment with STL containers (Vector, Stack, List, Set, Map)
- Use iterators to traverse each container

---

## How to Run
Each day’s assignments are located in their respective folders (`Day1`, `Day2`, etc.). Open the folder for the day to find the `.cpp` or `.java` files with code solutions.

---

This README provides a detailed outline of each assignment covered over the 15 days. Check individual files in each day’s folder for the complete code and output. Happy coding!
